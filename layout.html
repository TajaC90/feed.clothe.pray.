							<h2>Our Story</h2>
								<p>
									The Beginning...

									On September 24th, a team of young adults filled with high spirits, formed a unit for a purpose after successfully accomplishing a memorable act of kindness. We gathered together to plan, execute and pray over our first Dry Run named #OperationsLunchBag. This occasion involved us organizing lunch bags with homemade sandwiches, a bag of chips and an 8oz bottle of water, along with a target to feed 50 individuals. In addition to our intention, we chose 125th and Lexington, to actively execute our mission due to the extensive amount of homelessness happening on a daily basis. As we approached an end to our event only lasting 20 minutes, we were left with notable statements full of gratitude such as “May I please have two?” “Thank you, you’re truly blessed” “God Bless you and you’re family” “Hey, we’ll be here every day” and “Tatiana: They are more people by the FDR. Come I’ll show you”.
								</p>

									<i><b>“Home is a notion that only nations of the homeless fully appreciate and only the uprooted comprehend.” - Wallace Stegner</b></i>

								<p>
									Reflecting on what we were able to do in just 20 minutes for 50 individuals, we were left propelled, inspirited and inspired to continue servicing our community. Now as a team, we have pledged to make each minute count by committing our time to make a world a peaceful place. With our forthcoming belief of giving, we are determined to create higher objectives in the number of individuals we are able to comfort, provide and supply. In conclusion, Feed. Clothe. Pray is simply here to serve in countless ways.
